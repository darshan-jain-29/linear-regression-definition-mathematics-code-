What is Linear Regression?
It is a relationship between 2 variables x and y where x = input or independent variables y = output or dependent value This relationship is in the form of a straight line that best tries to fit each variable.

Mathematically it can be defined as y = mx + c where x and y are as defined above, m = slope or coefficient of regression c = constant

General view of a straight line : y = mx + c
